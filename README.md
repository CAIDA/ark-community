## Introduction

CAIDA runs a global measurement platform called Archipelago (Ark). We expand
it by adding hardware measurement nodes, usually Raspberry Pi devices, in
diverse locations to get a better view of the global Internet. In 2024, we
also started supporting software-based Ark nodes.

Ark continuously collects data to help researchers and aims to:

 * Provide a secure, distributed platform for approved measurements.
 * Make it easier to create, deploy, and analyze large-scale Internet
   measurements.

Ark is designed for measurements that need coordination across multiple
locations. It runs ongoing measurement projects, creating public datasets on
Internet structure (e.g., the Internet Topology Data Kit). We also support
approved experiments to test new measurement techniques, keeping a record of
past and current projects.


## Questions, Issues, and Suggestions

We welcome anyone to get in touch with us if you have any questions about
the Ark project, getting access to data, or running your own measurements.
